# ThinkfulRails
These are the ruby files and notes I created as part of the Thinkful "Essentials of Full Stack Development in Rails" course. 
For me, they primarily serve as reference files as I know what they do when run and I can cross check against them if I have to write new ruby files which achieve a similar result.

If you're looking at these, hope they help you out as well!
